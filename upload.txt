MultipliCity alters map generation so that multiple cities are created randomly across the map, possibly overlapping. This makes the map more urban, but with a hopefully more interesting distribution than merely enlarging a single centralised city, as the example Bigger Cities mod does.

The mod attempts to cleanly merge cities which overlap, but can result in some "interesting" road layouts at the seams.

[h1]Known Bugs[/h1]

Global spawn points, commerce, and offices get placed toward the map centre, rather than the city centres. This is a bug/quirk of the original city generation code.

If you wish to correct this, open the Voxel Turf file scripts/server/map_generation/city_generation.lua, go to line 587, and replace the sortDistFunc function with:
[code]
local function sortDistFunc (a, b)
	return len2 (a.x - startX, a.z - startZ) < len2 (b.x - startX, b.z - startZ);
end	
[/code]
