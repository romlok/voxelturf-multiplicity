MultipliCity alters map generation so that multiple cities are created randomly across the map, possibly overlapping. This makes the map more urban, but with a hopefully more interesting distribution than merely enlarging a single centralised city, as the example Bigger Cities mod does.

The mod attempts to cleanly merge cities which overlap, but can result in some "interesting" road layouts at the seams.

[h1]Known Bugs[/h1]

Global spawn points, commerce, and offices get placed toward the map centre, rather than the city centres. This is a bug/quirk of the original city generation code.
